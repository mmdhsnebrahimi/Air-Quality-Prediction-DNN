# Deep Learning Project: Air Quality Prediction (DNN) 🌍☁️

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an Artificial Neural Networks course project. The primary objective is to design and develop a Deep Neural Network (DNN) from scratch to tackle a real-world regression problem: predicting air quality metrics. 

## Project Details
The Jupyter Notebook (`Air-Quality-Prediction-DNN.ipynb`) demonstrates the complete pipeline for a deep learning regression task using the **UCI Air Quality Dataset**. Instead of relying on high-level frameworks, this project features a custom-built `MultiLayerNN` class. The workflow includes robust data preprocessing (handling missing values and scaling features), building dynamic hidden layers, and optimizing the network iteratively to minimize prediction errors.

## Key Features
* **Custom DNN Architecture:** A flexible, from-scratch implementation of a Multi-Layer Neural Network (`MultiLayerNN`) capable of adapting to different layer configurations.
* **Real-World Dataset:** Processing and analyzing the UCI Air Quality dataset, focusing on sensor responses and environmental metrics.
* **Regression Optimization:** Training the network to predict continuous values rather than discrete classes, highlighting the versatility of deep learning.
* **Performance Metrics:** Rigorously evaluating the model's accuracy and convergence using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error
